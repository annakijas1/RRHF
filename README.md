Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductee Data

Data was extracted from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_inductees">List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductees</a> in Wikipedia covering 1986-2018 in the Performers category only.

- Raw data pulled from Wikipedia is included in CSV and JSON form (this data is only through 2016 and has been updated with [RRHF-2018.csv](https://github.com/annakijas1/RRHF/blob/master/RRHF-2018.csv)).
- Tableau workbook used for the visualization is included from the parsed data.

Please create an issue if you find any errors in the dataset and I will review them.
